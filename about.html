        Earth <br />
        <br />
        The Cradle of humanity, our only home for so long. Earth is a scientific
        marvel, a true rarity. The beacon of life in an otherwise lifeless
        galaxy. <br />
        Whether you are a resident of Earth or wishing to visit, we will
        facilitate your needs, OHS' and in-atmosphere flights are available.

        Luna <br />
        <br />
        Humanity's neighbour and protector, since the dawn of humanity itself,
        we have stared up at the little white rock with such curiosity and
        wonder. <br />
        Now it's the 24th Century and our dear friend Luna is finally another
        home for us. <br />
        We offer hotel stays and orbital flights around Luna regularly.

      <p>
        Mars <br />
        <br />
        The red planet. Our first extra-terrestrial colony, in the early 21st
        Century, Mars was the focus of so many great minds, minds that knew Mars
        was our biggest opportunity yet.<br />
        In 2048, humans first set foot on the dusty red rock, not long
        afterwards, expansive colonies spread throughout it's many caverns and
        mountains. <br />
        We offer flights, OHS stays and tours of Olympus Mons.

      <p>
        Jupiter <br />
        <br />
        The system brute, our bodyguard for four billion years, soaking in
        Earth-bound asteroids and protecting us from disaster. <br />
        The largest planet in our system, ravaged by storms but blessed with
        otherworldly beauty, Jupiter is host to over a hundred moons, big and
        small, with it's impressive gravitational field.<br />
        A breakthrough in modern habitat living was the high-Jovian atmospheric
        cloud cities, hovering above the mass of storms and harsh winds, our
        habitats remain one of the most sought after holiday experiences in the
        system.

      <p>
        Ganymede<br />
        <br />
        Jupiter's little brother, the biggest moon in the system, bigger than
        Mercury and Pluto. If Ganymede were orbiting the sun, it would be
        considered a planet.<br />
        The Jovian probe in the mid 2030s uncovered the wonders of this moon,
        with it's caverns of ice, cascades of shimmering diamonds and stunning
        sights of Jupiter, Ganymede is certainly an underrated destination, one
        that we thoroughly recommend.

        Saturn<br />
        <br />
        Another gas giant, a truly beautiful planet, with it's distinctive ring
        and countless moons, including Titan. Saturn is host to a stunning ring,
        which holds dozens of our orbital hotels.<br />
        Imagine it, waking up and looking out at the staggering imagery of
        Saturn and its' ring.
