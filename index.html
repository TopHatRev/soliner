    <h2>Why we do what we do.</h2>

    <section class="infoRows">

      <p>
        For millennia humanity has been looking up to the stars and wishing that
        they could one day take a closer look. <br />
        We've been looking to our own moon since the dawn of man, a beacon in an
        otherwise dark sky. <br />
        At SoLiner, we've taken that hope and ambition from the centuries of
        dreamers before us and made it a reality. <br />
        Humanity has never been so in touch with our solar neighbours. Thanks to
        our founders and those that funded us, we can finally send ordinary men
        and women on voyages that would've been deemed impossible only 100 years
        ago.

        <br />
        In the last century, no SoLiner vessels have ever been critically
        damaged and no passenger has been endangered.
